# AyAPI

AyAPI is a thin [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) wrapper for
python-only AI features I want to use in SPAs.

Source code is shared in the spirit of sharing, but you most likely
want to create your own wrapper instead of trying to reuse this one.
It's very specific for my needs at the time of writing.
